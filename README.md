# Medical LLMüöÄü™ê

Welcome to the Medical LLM repository, your premier gateway to a structured and meticulously designed pipeline exclusively crafted for large language models (LLMs) based medical projects. In a domain where precision, accuracy, and reliability are paramount, leveraging the advanced capabilities of LLMs in medical data interpretation and analysis becomes a pivotal element. This project roots deeply into ensuring medical data, including but not limited to medical imaging and tabular reports, can be efficiently processed, interpreted, and utilized using LLMs, particularly focusing on the Llama 2 model.

Harnessing the power of LLMs, this repository aspires to create a pipeline that not only adeptly parses through vast and multifaceted medical data but also curates and converts it into a structured format, ready for in-depth analysis and utilization in various medical applications.

## Background
### LLM in Medical Sector: A Glimpse of Relevance
In the sprawling field of medical science, dealing with colossal amounts of data is routine. This data, ranging from medical images to intricate reports, holds within it the potential to unravel novel insights, support diagnostic processes, and fortify medical research. Large Language Models like Llama 2 propose a prolific methodology to tap into this potential by offering capabilities like natural language understanding, generation, and, crucially for our purposes, transformation of unstructured data into structured formats.

### Why Llama 2?
[Llama 2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) is a potent LLM developed by Meta AI, offering a splendid array of features such as enhanced natural language understanding and expansive knowledge retrieval. Its unique capability to utilize grammar for refining output into predefined formats, such as JSON, aligns seamlessly with our objective of structuring medical data for further analysis and application.

### Leveraging llama.cpp
Our project strategically employs [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), an adept C++ adaptation of the Llama model. This integration not only allows us to exploit the capabilities of Llama 2 but also facilitates a robust, efficient, and performant pipeline, tailored to navigate through the extensive and diverse arrays of medical data.
