arrival to ___ ED, patient was indeed hemodynamically stable

Therefore,
removing the obstruction may not completely free up his voiding
such that he may still have an elevated residual urine volume,
but it should be better than it is today.  In addition, I will
leave a small amount of extra tissue at the apex to assure
against incontinence as the entire prostatic area may be

otherwise had no changes to her diet. In ___, she was 
hospitalized for hypoxia in the setting of COPD and dCHF 
exacerbation, treated with steroids, antibiotics and diuresis. 
CT during that hospitalization showed pulmonary nodules, 
mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and bone lesions concerning for 
malignancy. She underwent transbronchial biopsy of mediastinal 
node, which was negative for malignant cells, and flow cytometry 
showed nonspecific T-cell dominant lymphoproliferation not 
consistent with malignancy. At pulmonology follow-up, she was 
given a diagnosis of tobacco-related lung disease.

further workup which included chest CT, VATS biopsy, and flow 
cytometry, which showed eosinophilic infiltrate with fibrosis 
but no granulomas or vasculitis. She also underwent skin biopsy 
that showed subacute spongiotic dermatitis with mixed 
inflammatory infiltrate and prominent perivascular and 
interstitial eosinophilic component, consistent with a florid 
hypersensitivity reaction. SPEP/UPEP and kappa and light chain 
studies were negative. She was treated initially with 
azithromycin and doxycycline for presumed COPD exacerbation with 
no improvement in her symptoms. Her home amlodipine, furosemide, 
and olmesartan were held due to concern that her symptoms were 
consistent with drug reaction. Her neurologist Dr. ___ 
___ was contacted and advised the team not to changed her 
AEDs. She was transfered to ___ due to concern that her 
medications may need to be discontinued, which would require

abnormal
eye movements, oral or facial automatism, or abnormal movement 
of
the limbs.  She has had the episodes while seated, and has been

hand became numb, which then came to  include his whole arm

30 minutes later.  He initially felt that this might be
neuropathic, as with his legs, but this was very marked and
sudden.  His chest felt tight without pain after that, and he 
was
unsure whether this was because he was anxious.  He felt short 
of
breath and dizzy and needed to grab the wall.  At this point he
told his girlfriend.  She told him to lie down.  At this time, 
he
felt very dizzy, without the room spinning.  The ceiling looked
'wavy'.  He called his doctor who urged presentation.  He tried
to eat something but was too shaky and felt dizzy.  His
girlfriend drove him to his PCP.  The PCP noted that his speech
was slurred.  He additionally notes that he hesitates a little
with speech - he feels that speaking is less fluid.  He does not
like taking an ambulance, so he came immediately by car, his
girlfriend driving, to the ED.  His glucose this AM was 120 and
is was similar on arrival to the ED.  He was hot and sweaty in
the car and rolled the window down, but is not sure if he was
confused - he 'wasn't myself'.  He was not speaking very much
earlier on to determine if speech was affected, but feels that
his speech is a little slower and formulation of a sentence is
subjective slower for him.  He has had low blood sugar before,
but not terribly low - he cannot recall how this felt.  He has
not felt like this before.  The chest tightness reminds him of
his arrhythmia, but is only tight today with pain.
